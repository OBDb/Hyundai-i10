    description: "The original Hyundai i10 was introduced as a city car primarily for European and Asian markets. Replacing the Atos/Santro in Hyundai's lineup, it featured simple, practical styling with a tall profile to maximize interior space within a small footprint. Powered by small displacement engines typically ranging from 1.0L to 1.2L, it emphasized efficiency and affordability. The interior was basic but functional, with durable materials and a straightforward layout. Despite its entry-level positioning, it offered features often not found in its class, including options for air conditioning, power windows, and airbags even on base models in many markets. This generation established the i10 as a strong competitor in the A-segment, particularly in Europe and India, where it won numerous awards for its combination of practicality, reliability, and value."

    description: "The second-generation i10 featured more sophisticated styling with a wider stance and more dynamic proportions. Slightly larger than its predecessor, it offered improved interior space that approached B-segment levels despite its A-segment classification. Engine options continued with refined 1.0L and 1.2L petrol units, with some markets receiving LPG or diesel variants. The interior saw significant improvements in design, materials, and technology, offering features unusual for its class including available touchscreen infotainment, climate control, and heated seats on higher trims. Safety features expanded to include standard stability control and up to six airbags. This generation elevated the i10's position in the market, competing with larger, more expensive cars on features while maintaining its fundamental city car practicality and economy."

    description: "The current i10 represents another step forward in sophistication, featuring more expressive styling with a larger cascading grille, aggressive light signatures, and more sculpted body sides. Built on a new platform, it maintains similar external dimensions to its predecessor while offering improved interior space and refinement. Engine options typically include 1.0L three-cylinder and 1.2L four-cylinder units, with some markets receiving a turbocharged 1.0L option in sportier N Line variants. The interior features a significant technology upgrade with an available 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, something rare in the A-segment. Safety technology has advanced considerably with Hyundai SmartSense features including autonomous emergency braking, lane keep assist, and driver attention warning available on higher trims. This generation aims to offer B-segment features and refinement in an A-segment package, addressing the trend of buyers expecting higher quality and more technology even in the smallest car classes. Despite challenging market conditions for small cars in Europe, the i10 continues to be a significant model for Hyundai in urban-focused markets."
